# Frank-Fella-Projects
Examples of projects used in Frank Fella's Java training sessions.

Each folder may contain multiple projects showing various features and technology related to the overall focus of the training objective.

**Note:** These projects were created for an academic environment to teach non-technical, new to I.T. students introductory programming skills in a boot camp environment.  Thus the coding techniques, features and styles were designed to facilitate learning and understanding.

Had these projects been coded for a real-world production environment, different more advanced or efficient coding techniques, styles and feature would have been used.
