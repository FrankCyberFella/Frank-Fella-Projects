Frankmo - Cash Sharing/Payment App

Congratulationsâ€”you've landed a job with Frankmo, whose product is an online payment service for transferring "Frankmo Bucks" between friends. However, they don't have a product yet. Parts of the project have been started, you have been tasked with completing the remaining features using the partial RESTful API server and command-line application given.


**The required use cases of the client code is complete.**

**You will only be working on the server side of the project.  Data access and controllers.**

**You will use Postman to test your server side code.**

**You may try to run the client code to test your server side code ***AFTER***  you have tested it with Postman.**

## Use cases

### Required use cases

You should attempt to complete all of the following required use cases.

> Note: there are two check constraints in the DDL that creates the `transfer` table. Be sure to take a look at `frankmo.sql` to understand these constraints.

## How to set up the database

Create a new Postgres database called `frankmo`. Run the `database/frankmo.sql` script in pgAdmin to set up the database.

### Datasource

A Datasource has been configured for you in `/src/resources/application.properties`. 

```
# datasource connection properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/frankmo
spring.datasource.name=frankmo
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres1
```

### JdbcTemplate

If you look in `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/dao`, you'll see `JdbcUserDao`. This is an example of how to get an instance of `JdbcTemplate` in your DAOs. If you declare a field of type `JdbcTemplate` and add it as an argument to the constructor, Spring automatically injects an instance for you:

```java
@Service
public class JdbcUserDao implements UserDao {

    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public JdbcUserDao(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }
}
```

## Testing


### DAO integration tests

`com.techelevator.dao.BaseDaoTests` has been provided for you to use as a base class for any DAO integration test. It initializes a Datasource for testing and manages rollback of database changes between tests.

`com.techelevator.dao.JdbUserDaoTests` has been provided for you as an example for writing your own DAO integration tests.

Remember that when testing, you're using a copy of the real database. The schema and data for the test database are defined in `/src/test/resources/test-data.sql`. The schema in this file matches the schema defined in `database/frankmo.sql`.


## Authentication / Finding a Logged In User Information

The user registration and authentication functionality for the system has already been implemented. If you review the login code, you'll notice that after successful authentication, an instance of `AuthenticatedUser` is stored in the `currentUser` member variable of `App`. The user's authorization tokenâ€”meaning JWTâ€”can be accessed from `App` as `currentUser.getToken()`.

When the use cases refer to an "authenticated user", this means a request that includes the token as a header. You can also reference other information about the current user by using the `User` object retrieved from `currentUser.getUser()`.

Review the code given in the client-side `ConsoleService`, `displayAnAccount()` method for examples on use of the `currentUser` object to obtain information about a user.

## Things to consider before you start working on your project

1. Start the server provided to be sure it starts without error.
2. Start the client provided and register at least one user.
3. Use PGAdmin to verify that an account and user has been successfully created in the database.
4. Use PostMan to test the endpoints provided for the frankmo app:
   1. `/account` - should return all accounts in the database
   2. `/account?userid=userid` - (example: `/account?userid=1001`) - should return all accounts for the userid 1001
   3. `/account/accountId` - (example: `/account/2001`) - should return the account 2001
   4. `/user` - should return all registered users 
   5. `/user?userid=userid` - (example: `/user?userid=1001`) - should return user with userid 1001
5. Optional: Update the balance in an account using PostMan:
   1. Set the request type to `PUT`
   2. Set the URL to: `http://localhost:8080/account`
   3. Add/Check for a Header: `Content-Type application/json`
   4. Add `raw` JSON in the Body of the request with the required values. The values shown below are for the first account added to the database.  Choose any value you'd like (that is not the current balance):
         ```
         {
            "account_id" : 2001,
            "user_id"    : 1001,
            "balance"    : 31952
         }
         ```
   5. `Send` the request to the server.    
   6. You should receive a JSON object for the account showing the changed balance.
   7. If you get a status code `200` and nothing returned, be sure the account you specified in the JSON exists then check the messages on the server side for an error.
   8. If you set a status code other than `200`, check the messages on the server side for an error. 
6. Sample JSON for testing your Transfer contoller processing from Postman:
   
      ```
       {
      	"transferId": 99999,
	      "transferStatus": "APPROVED",
	      "transferType": "SEND",
	      "fromfrankmoAccount": {
	                        	"account_id" : "2001",
	                        	"user_id"    : "1001",
	                        	"balance"    : "8888.88"
                             },
	      "tofrankmoAccount":   {
		                        "account_id" : "2002",
		                        "user_id"    : "1002",
		                        "balance"    : "9999.99"
  	                          },
	      "amount": "12345.67"
      }
     ``` 

1. Review the `Module-2 Capstone Design.pdf` and be sure you understand the overall design of the system as well as the purpose of each component and what they interact with.

   Also be sure you understand the project structure of the client-side and server-side projects provided and the purpose/use of each folder, package and class given in each project.   

2. Review all the code given related to the frankmo Application in the client packages (`model`, `ConsoleService`, `frankmoService`) and the `App` class.  Code in these may be used a model for new features you will be implmenting.
3.  Use IntelliJ to find the `TODO`s in the client code `frankmoService`.  It will help you focus on what to do next. If you don't know how to do this, ask your instructor for assistance. Note: Although the `TODO`s are in the client code `frankmoService`, some of them may require coding on the serer-side as well.
4.  Review all the code given related to the frankmo Applicationand in the server packages (`controller.frankmoContoller`, `datasource`). Code in these may be used a model for new features you will be implmenting. 
5.  Remember:  **Analyze**, **Design**, **Code**, **Refactor**
6.  Follow the ***Happy Path*** first. Don't worry about edge cases until your ***Happy Path***s are done.
7.  ***Don't overthink the problem***.  If you have designed a viable solution, code and test it before you decide it's wrong or needs tweaking. That's what **Refactor** is for. It is much easier to debug code that is written than trying to debug code as you write it.
